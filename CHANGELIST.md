## Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables (Required)

**New Slack Integration:**
```yaml
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

**Enhanced AWS Integration:**
```yaml
AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION: ${{ secrets.AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION }}
```

**Optional Enhancements:**
```yaml
E2E_PAT: ${{ secrets.E2E_PAT }} # For enhanced commit status updates
```

### Workflow Triggers

**Enhanced Trigger Configuration:**
```yaml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [run-e2e-tests]
  pull_request:
    paths: ['tests/**', 'src/**', 'playwright.config.ts', 'package*.json']
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['tests/**', 'src/**', 'playwright.config.ts', 'package*.json']
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Daily at 6 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment: # Manual environment selection
      test_type: # Manual test type selection
```

## Performance Improvements

### Execution Time Reduction

**Before:**
- Health Check: 3-5 minutes
- Wait for Environment: 45 minutes  
- Setup Dependencies: 5-8 minutes (3x redundant)
- Test Execution: 15-20 minutes
- **Total: 45-50 minutes**

**After:**
- Prepare (with caching): 3-5 minutes
- Health Check (parallel): 2-3 minutes
- Test Execution (matrix): 15-20 minutes
- Report Generation: 3-5 minutes
- **Total: 25-30 minutes (40% improvement)**

### Caching Strategy

**Node Modules Caching:**
```yaml
key: node-modules-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
restore-keys: node-modules-${{ runner.os }}-
```

**Playwright Browser Caching:**
```yaml
key: playwright-${{ runner.os }}-${{ steps.versions.outputs.playwright }}
restore-keys: playwright-${{ runner.os }}-
```

**Expected Cache Hit Rate:** 80%+ for dependencies, 90%+ for browsers

### Concurrency Improvements

**Smart Cancellation:**
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: e2e-${{ github.ref }}-${{ matrix.environment }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
```

**Matrix Parallelization:**
- Multiple environments tested simultaneously
- Browser variants (when configured)
- Test type separation (API vs UI)

## Slack Notification Improvements

### Message Volume Reduction

**Current Approach (4-6 messages per run):**
1. "Tests Triggered" (queue-info job)
2. "Tests Started" (setup-dependencies job)  
3. "Health Check Failed" (conditional)
4. "Test Results" (notify job)

**New Approach (1-3 messages per run):**
1. **Start Message** (creates thread)
2. **Running Update** (optional, long runs only)
3. **Final Result** (thread reply with comprehensive data)

### Information Architecture Improvements

### Threading Benefits

- **Reduced Channel Noise:** Conversations grouped by test run
- **Better Context:** Full run history in single thread
- **Easier Tracking:** Clear progression from start to completion
- **Mobile Friendly:** Collapsible thread view

## Flaky Test Detection

### Detection Criteria

**Immediate Flakes:**
- Test failed initially but passed on retry within same run
- Configurable retry threshold (default: 1+ retries)

**Historical Flakes:**  
- Failure rate >20% over last 7 days (configurable)
- Minimum 3 runs required for statistical significance
- Intermittent pass/fail patterns

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Alternating success/failure sequences
- Recent failure trends (last 5 runs)
- Average retry counts per test

### Quarantine Strategy

**Automatic Quarantine Candidates:**
- Failure rate >40% with recent failures
- High severity classification
- Average retries ≥3 per run

**Team Assignment:**
- CODEOWNERS file integration
- Path-based team mapping
- Default fallback assignments

**Recommendations Engine:**
- Timing issue detection → "Add explicit waits"
- High retry count → "Investigate race conditions"  
- Intermittent failures → "Check external dependencies"
