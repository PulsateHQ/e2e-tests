### Current Workflows

#### 1. Main E2E Workflow (`tests.yml`)
- **Trigger**: `repository_dispatch` with environment payload
- **Environments**: leopard, sealion, jaguar, puma, bear, tiger, whale
- **Jobs**: queue-info → wait-for-environment → health-check → setup-dependencies → test → reports → notify
- **Duration**: ~45-50 minutes (45min wait + 5min execution)
- **Concurrency**: Per-environment with no cancellation

#### 2. Daily UI Tests (`ui-tests-daily.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Scheduled daily at 6:00 AM UTC
- **Environment**: sealion only
- **Jobs**: health-check → setup-dependencies → test → reports → notify
- **Duration**: ~15-20 minutes

#### 3. Code Quality (`quality-check.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Push/PR to main
- **Jobs**: Prettier + ESLint validation
- **Duration**: ~3-5 minutes

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Workflow Structure Issues

#### Redundant Job Structure
- **Problem**: Identical setup steps duplicated across jobs (health-check, setup-dependencies, test)
- **Impact**: Increased maintenance burden, inconsistent caching
- **Solution**: Consolidate into matrix-based approach with shared setup

#### Inefficient Dependency Management
- **Problem**: Dependencies installed 3 times per workflow run
- **Impact**: 6-9 minutes of unnecessary installation time
- **Solution**: Single setup job with artifact sharing

#### Poor Concurrency Control
- **Problem**: No cancellation of in-progress runs on new commits
- **Impact**: Resource waste, delayed feedback
- **Solution**: Implement cancel-in-progress for PR workflows

### 2. Slack Notification Problems

#### Message Noise and Redundancy
```
Current: 4-6 messages per test run
- Test Triggered (queue-info)
- Test Started (setup-dependencies)  
- Health Check Failed (conditional)
- Test Results (always)

Proposed: 1-3 messages per test run
- Thread: Started → [Running Update] → Final Result
```

#### Poor Information Architecture
- **Problem**: Verbose, repetitive text with low signal-to-noise ratio
- **Impact**: Important failures lost in noise, poor actionability
- **Solution**: Structured Block Kit with key metrics upfront

#### No Threading or Deduplication
- **Problem**: Each message creates new channel entry
- **Impact**: Channel spam, difficult to track run progress
- **Solution**: Thread-based updates with deduplication

### 3. Test Execution Issues

#### No Matrix Strategy
- **Problem**: Single environment per workflow run
- **Impact**: No parallel testing across environments
- **Solution**: Matrix-based execution for applicable scenarios

#### Limited Retry Strategy
- **Problem**: Basic Playwright retries only (retries: 1)
- **Impact**: Flaky tests cause false failures
- **Solution**: Enhanced retry with flaky test detection

#### Missing Artifact Strategy
- **Problem**: Artifacts only uploaded on test job completion
- **Impact**: Limited debugging capability for setup failures
- **Solution**: Always upload artifacts with proper naming

### 4. Monitoring and Observability

#### No Flaky Test Detection
- **Problem**: No systematic tracking of test reliability
- **Impact**: Unreliable CI/CD feedback, wasted developer time
- **Solution**: Automated flaky test detection and quarantine

#### Limited Performance Metrics
- **Problem**: No duration tracking or performance regression detection
- **Impact**: Gradual CI/CD slowdown without visibility
- **Solution**: Performance metrics collection and trending

## Proposed Architecture

### Improved Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [run-e2e-tests]
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * *"

permissions:
  contents: read
  checks: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: e2e-${{ github.ref }}-${{ matrix.environment }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  prepare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      test-environments: ${{ steps.environments.outputs.environments }}
      playwright-version: ${{ steps.versions.outputs.playwright }}
    steps:
      - name: Determine test environments
      - name: Setup dependencies and cache
      - name: Post start notification

      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        environment: ${{ fromJson(needs.prepare.outputs.test-environments) }}

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Aggregate results
      - name: Generate reports
      - name: Post final notification
```

### Enhanced Slack Notification Strategy

#### Threading Architecture
1. **Start Message**: Create thread with run context
2. **Progress Updates**: Update thread for long-running operations
3. **Final Result**: Comprehensive summary with metrics

#### Block Kit Structure
```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "text": "E2E Result • leopard • ❌ Failed"
    },
    {
      "type": "context", 
      "elements": [
        "Repo: Smokesignals",
        "Commit: 4077c1d", 
        "Duration: 24m"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "fields": [
        "Passed: 152",
        "Failed: 3", 
        "Flaky: 2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": "Top Failures:\n• checkout.spec.ts — timeout\n• login.spec.ts — 401 error"
    },
    {
      "type": "actions",
      "elements": ["Run Details", "Allure Report", "Artifacts"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Improvements

### Caching Strategy
- **Node modules**: Shared across all jobs with lockfile-based keys
- **Playwright browsers**: Version-specific caching with OS consideration
- **Allure history**: Persistent S3-based history for trend analysis

### Execution Optimization
- **Parallel setup**: Dependencies and browser installation in parallel
- **Conditional execution**: Skip unnecessary steps based on cache hits
- **Resource efficiency**: Right-size job timeouts and resource allocation

### Expected Performance Gains
- **Setup time**: 15 minutes → 5 minutes (67% reduction)
- **Total runtime**: 50 minutes → 30 minutes (40% reduction)
- **Resource usage**: 40% reduction in compute minutes

## Flaky Test Detection Strategy

### Detection Criteria
1. **Immediate flakes**: Failed then passed on retry within same run
2. **Historical flakes**: >20% failure rate over last 10 runs
3. **Intermittent flakes**: Alternating pass/fail pattern

### Quarantine Process
1. **Automatic tagging**: Add `@flaky` tag to detected tests
2. **Owner assignment**: Use CODEOWNERS for responsibility
3. **Isolation runs**: Nightly execution of quarantined tests
4. **Reporting**: Weekly flaky test digest to stakeholders

### Implementation
```javascript
// scripts/ci/flaky-detector.js
const flakyTests = await detectFlakyTests({
  historyDays: 7,
  minRuns: 5,
  flakyThreshold: 0.2
});

await generateReport({
  tests: flakyTests,
  owners: await getCodeOwners(),
  format: ['json', 'markdown']
});
```
